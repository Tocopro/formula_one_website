Following the requirements laid out for the assignment, I designed a simple webpage from scratch that will
Showcase some basics about formula racing technology.
The html for the website has the following.
<ul>
    <li>	Main body
    <li>	Header section
    <li>	Navigation section
    <li>	An image sections
    <li>	An article written describing the purpose of the website
    <li>	A second image depicting the formula one Mercedes team racing cars
    <li>	A clickable section with three choices
    <li>	A subscribers information input with three inputs only first, last name and email.
    <li>	A footer section with a brief text 
</ul>
The main webpage consists of three sections
The header
Main body
Footer(webpage conclusion)
Each section provides the necessary information for the user to view and ease of use.
The users will interact with the UI at the navigation bar to direct the user to different sections as desired
i.e., the main page of the website, the creators contact, the news information related to the web page
subject and about which is a brief text biography with a photo of the website author.
Then the users will view an image of a formula one car before scrolling down to the main article.
After the main article is another image of the Mercedes formula one racing car 2021.
The user scrolls down further and will see a click section with three features of the formula one car
And URL links.
After the click section the user will scroll further down to the last section of the webpage with a text
Then after the footer section, the web page incorporates an emoji which points to a link that can open a video content
describing briefly the wire frame for the webpage
About subscription and a form input section to input first and last name as well as email.
In the CSS section
The CSS section enables different styling techniques to be incorporated into the webpage using an external file
CSS with a linkable attribute to the main html file.
Background color and font sizes as well as the flex box that wraps the image and clickable links in the section after 
The second image.
All the attributes of styling to the webpage is done in the CSS file.
All the content is sizeable to various screen sizes from minimum of 480px wide to a maximum of 680px wide
Content adjustment to fit the screen and a few attribute changes to the website elements color and font.
Then another adjustment of a minimum 680 pixels wide to a full screen.
I have included comments in the html file as well as CSS file to guide feature code reviewers who may need to understand the
Various sections of the webpage.
I will also include a wire frame picture of the initial design steps of the webpage. The wire frame enabled me to visualize 
How the website and its content will appear at the final step of launching it.
I will also include an image of the website page on README as well as the URL for the Github remote repository.

I have attached an HTML file labeled wire frame to be viewed in any browser
