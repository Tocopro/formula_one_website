    <article id="article1">
        Formula One Motor sport is dominated by Ferrari and Mercedes Benz teams. But recently the Red bull team
        Has been taking the first finish position in many races. One thing I have noticed over the few racing seasons,
        recently, was that if a team won some race or races, they would tend to dominate and win almost all the
        Races for that season and even more several seasons later.<br><br>
        Now some fans would probably think the driver has a good racing car that season(s) or the drivers
        Skills have been improving and the results currently are proof of that. I would like to think, formula one racing
        Is a sport of strategy or plan more than a driver’s skills or car's performance. Although I do acknowledge those features 
        are very important In winning races obviously, but the word formula one comes with rules, which are designed to place all the
        Participating teams on an even plane.<br><br>
        There is unspoken fact that there is black magic involved in placing the cars at an added advantage over the
        other teams who are competing.<br><br>
        One big racing overall car performance influence is aerodynamics. The difference between a few seconds lead 
        comes down to how the car can manage aerodynamics forces without compromising performance.
        Engines, suspensions, Tires are also very important in a car’s performance and handling. But the dark art of
        designing aerodynamics to give an edge over other drivers is the biggest overall determinant which driver has a lead or best season performance.<br><br>
        
        And here comes the unspoken truth about all these, there is cheating or bending rules but done in ways that
        formula one scouts or other teams cannot detect easily. The team with the smartest aerodynamic cheat will certainly dominate the
        race.<br><br>
        So is formula one really a competition on who can fool the other without being caught. That I will leave it to the fans
        to decide.<br><br>
        I am not a technology expert in how the formula is designed or enforced, but I will say that lately there is proof that 
        if a team can figure out how to overcome an obstacle with technology and strategy, they will dominate the podium finish.
        With that I have included some formula one features that are incorporated into the racing cars that are the most important 
        in formula one by including features by Mercedes Formula one Car.<br><br>
        Please enjoy!
