<p id="introduction_paragraph">
  My name is Nicholas, and I am currently a student with the University of Minnesota bootcamp.
  I have an interest in formula one as a motorsport. The use of technology in the race by different teams
  fascinates me.
  so I created this newsletter to share with other formula one fans different ideas about the sport.
